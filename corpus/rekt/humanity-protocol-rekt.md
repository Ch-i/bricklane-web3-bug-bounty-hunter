# Humanity Protocol - Rekt

_Loss: $36,400,000_  
_Incident date: 6/8/2026_  
_Pre-exploit audit: N/A_  

> Seven keys on one laptop handed an attacker $36.4 million from Humanity Protocol across Ethereum and BSC. Rare for its kind, the owner of the compromised device was publicly named. The code wasn't broken. The key management was, and nobody's been held accountable for either.

_[Humanity Protocol sold the world a palm scan and a promise](https://www.humanity.org/blog/humanity-protocol-raises-30m-at-a-1-billion-valuation-to-build-zero-knowledge-worldcoin-competitor) - that in a sea of bots, AI slop, and synthetic identity, their blockchain could tell you who was real._  
  
**["The trust layer of the internet,"](https://en.bloomingbit.io/feed/news/109375) founder and CEO Terence Kwok called it. [Proof of Humanity, a self-described zero-knowledge Worldcoin competitor.](https://www.humanity.org/blog/humanity-protocol-raises-30m-at-a-1-billion-valuation-to-build-zero-knowledge-worldcoin-competitor)**  
  

On June 8, 2026, someone walked through the front door using a stolen key, rewrote the rules of the protocol mid-game, and [left with 447 million $H](https://thedefiant.io/news/hacks/humanity-protocol-post-mortem-malware-developer-machine-seven-keys) tokens, [$36.4 million of which has already been confirmed moving through Uniswap](https://arkm.com/explorer/address/0x9e995952eF7665B243eeEF0693acD7FEd7150504).

[ ](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064281691016048761)Three of six multisig keys, enough to cross the signing threshold, [were later said to have been backed up to a compromised employee laptop.](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064281691016048761)  
  
[No timelock stood between that threshold and absolute control](https://x.com/QuillAudits_AI/status/2064340289901527187). The attacker didn't break the code. They just became the admin.  
  

_Within hours, [ZachXBT was on X calling it a "crime pump"](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064191049267052853) and demanding the team disclose their market maker agreements with a Hong Kong entity._  
  
**[PeckShield was running the on-chain trail](https://t.me/peckshield/54468) and arriving at a darker conclusion, one that would later call the incident not a hack at all, but a staged performance.**  
  
[And banteg surfaced an on-chain message from the attacker to Chris Blec](https://x.com/banteg/status/2064220226070130998), a single sentence that exposed the state of Humanity Protocol's security more clearly than any post-mortem could.

  
A project built to verify human identity couldn't secure its own keys. A foundation assembled to govern the trust layer of the internet had, [as one of its founding directors, Mario Nawfal](https://www.humanity.org/blog/humanity-protocol-launches-the-humanity-foundation), one of crypto's most prolific hype merchants.  
  
The founder's earlier company had [already consumed roughly $170 million before collapsing.](https://protos.com/how-humanity-protocol-ceo-drove-his-previous-firm-to-insolvency/)

**[Specter flagged it](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/2064106420560408824) first.**

[Specter highlighted that wallets that had interacted with Humanity Protocol were being drained](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/2064106420560408824), 17 of them, at that point.
  
[Losses were already past $5 million](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/2064106420560408824) and climbing at the time.  
  
The root cause was still unknown, but the pattern was hard to misread - something connected to the protocol itself had been compromised, and the money was moving fast. [Theft addresses were already hitting the timeline.](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/2064106420560408824)

An hour and a half later, [ Specter was back with an update.](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/2064127980813582627) Losses had crossed $20 million. $9 million had already been swapped into ETH. Another $9.9 million in $H was sitting in attacker-controlled wallets, not yet converted, as if whoever was behind this was in no particular hurry. $H was already down 87% from the sell pressure alone.

_**[Terence Kwok roughly half an hour later](https://x.com/terencekwok/status/2064137106893705444), the statement was measured, minimal, and notably vague about what had actually happened:**  "We've detected a security incident involving the compromise of private keys belonging to a member of the Humanity Foundation. As a precaution, please do not interact with the bridge or any liquidity pools until we confirm it's safe."_

A private key. One member. That framing would not survive the night.

**[A fuller official statement followed from the Humanity account](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064167144120877127), warning users about scammers and impersonators, confirming the team was working with security experts and exchange partners, and drawing a hard line:** Official updates would only come from the protocol account or from Kwok directly.

[Standard incident playbook.](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064167144120877127) Nothing in either post told holders how bad it was, or how much worse it was about to get.

[Beosin was already on the case.](https://x.com/BeosinAlert/status/2064162765430993226) By early evening they had traced approximately $16.2 million in $H swapped into ETH and consolidated at a single address. The picture it painted was not one of chaos. It was methodical.

Then [PeckShield flagged something that changed the shape of the story entirely.](https://x.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/2064182522754601203) An attacker-controlled address on BNB Chain had minted 100 million $H directly from the null address.  
  
[New tokens, printed from nothing through a malicious unlimited mint function](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064281691016048761) the attacker had just deployed.  
  
[A second batch of 100 million](https://x.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/2064201741764337730) followed. Then another. Then more, [multiple tranches across BSC before the protocol could respond](https://x.com/QuillAudits_AI/status/2064340286374027613).

This was no longer a wallet drain. Someone had rewritten the rules of the token mid-game.

**[ZachXBT arrived shortly after, and he did not arrive quietly](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064187246815989893):** "The 'incident' seems possibly staged. I am not buying the teams story, it's a convenient way for the active MM to have exited."

**[Twenty minutes later he escalated](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064191049267052853):** "You choose to crime pump your token for weeks with zero fundamentals and think CT will blindly trust your story? Disclose your active MM agreements with the HK entity first…"

Two things in that later post were notable.  
  
First, [the accusation wasn't just about the hack](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064191049267052853), it was about the weeks before it. [](https://decrypt.co/370485/humanity-protocol-loses-36m-after-private-keys-compromised-token-crashes-73) [The up only chart behavior](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/humanity?chart=type%3Dprice%26mode%3Dline%26timeframe%3Dd90), that ZachXBT himself [described as a token being "crime pumped for weeks with zero fundamentals."](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064191049267052853)

**Second, [the demand](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064191049267052853):** Name the Hong Kong market maker. Publicly. The team never did.

_**By later that night, [banteg surfaced the on-chain message the attacker had sent to Chris Blec](https://x.com/banteg/status/2064220226070130998) - and whatever ambiguity remained about the state of Humanity Protocol's internal security evaporated in a single sentence:** "i was stressing out about needing to social engineer four different devs across three different timezones. then you drop a revelation that it's actually just one guy with six signer keys in his metamask. thank you king."_

Not a sophisticated operation that cracked a hardened target, a relief operation.  
  
**The attacker had been prepared for a difficult job and discovered, mid-execution, that someone had already done it for them.**

_When the attacker finds your security setup funnier than you do, how do you explain that to the people who trusted you with their money?_

### One Bad Laptop  
  

_The official explanation [arrived on June 9](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852)._  
  
**[A developer's laptop had been infected with malware](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852). The attacker obtained full root access to the machine.**  
  
[Seven production private keys had been backed up to that device approximately one year earlier](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852), during mainnet setup.  
  
No smart contract was exploited. No protocol logic was broken. [Every action the attacker took was technically legitimate, they were simply using credentials they had no right to hold.](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852)

  
Seven keys, one machine, backed up there a year ago and never rotated out. No red flags here, right?  
  
_[The Incident Update framed this as an operational security failure](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852) rather than an architectural one._  
  
**That framing is technically accurate and almost entirely beside the point. The architecture was built on an assumption - that the keys would stay separate, stay safe, stay distributed. When that assumption failed, there was nothing underneath it.**

[No timelock on the ProxyAdmin](https://x.com/QuillAudits_AI/status/2064340289901527187), no circuit breaker, no monitoring window between the moment the signing threshold was crossed and the moment the upgrade executed.  
  
The design required the keys to be secure. They weren't. Everything that followed was automatic.  
  

**[Terence Kwok told CoinTelegraph what happened in more precise terms](https://cointelegraph.com/news/humanity-protocol-laptop-bridge-exploit-h-token):** "What we believe happened was some of the keys were accidentally backed up to a compromised device."  
  
_[He added that for certain contracts](https://cointelegraph.com/news/humanity-protocol-laptop-bridge-exploit-h-token), multisig keys were "set up in one place and then dispersed," leaving some backed up on a compromised device._

**[Kwok also confirmed that the multisig controls were spread across just four individuals](https://cointelegraph.com/news/humanity-protocol-laptop-bridge-exploit-h-token), meaning in a six-signer Safe, some people held more than one key.**

[A multisig with six signers provides meaningful protection](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064281691016048761) only if those signers are genuinely independent, different people, different machines, different attack surfaces.  
  
[Three of the six Ethereum Safe owner keys and three of the five BSC Safe owner keys](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064281691016048761) were all recoverable from a single endpoint.  
  
The threshold required to execute was three. The attacker had three. The multisig was theater.  
  
_On June 11th, [Quantstamp published their preliminary investigation findings](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate), and named the person whose device was at the center of it all._  
  
**[Chong Yee Wai, a director of Humanity Protocol](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate), received a spear-phishing email on June 5, 2026 at 02:00 UTC.** 
  
[The email impersonated Korean exchange Bithumb with a malicious attachment](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate), Bithumb_Circulating_Supply_Lockup_Schedule.zip, hosted on an attacker-controlled domain.  
  
[Believing it to be genuine](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate), Chong downloaded it, filled out the spreadsheet, and cc'd his colleague Terence Kwok, who independently received the same phishing email at a different unique URL, a standard technique to track which victim was infected.  
  
[The attachment delivered hncagent.exe](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate), a first-stage loader signed with a South Korean Hancom certificate.[](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate)

_Quantstamp [noted the pattern was "characteristic of DPRK intrusions."](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate)_  
  
**By June 7, [the attacker had remote-desktop access to Chong's Windows machine](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate). Neither Sophos nor Windows Defender detected any of it.**

[From there, the attacker copied Chong's MetaMask Chrome extension and its encryption key](https://www.humanity.org/hincidentupdate), the same MetaMask the banteg message had already exposed held six signer keys.  
  
The next day, the on-chain attack was executed.

***[QuillAudits identified the compounding failure cleanly:](https://x.com/QuillAudits_AI/status/2064340289901527187)** The ProxyAdmin had no timelock.*
  
**In a system where the ProxyAdmin controls the upgrade path for both the bridge contract and the token logic, whoever holds that admin key holds everything.**  
  
[A 24-hour delay, combined with event monitoring on the AdminChanged function,](https://x.com/QuillAudits_AI/status/2064340289901527187) would have given the team a window to respond before a single token moved.  
  
That window did not exist. The moment the attacker crossed the Safe threshold, the outcome was already decided.  
  

[Banteg noted something else](https://protos.com/one-laptop-how-poor-security-ruined-humanity-protocol/) that [the incident report passed over quietly](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852). While the BSC Safe keys were rotated in the hours after the exploit became public, [the Ethereum wallet remained compromised for at least fourteen hours.](https://protos.com/one-laptop-how-poor-security-ruined-humanity-protocol/)  
  
_The team had begun responding on one chain while the attacker retained live access on the other. That gap, whether the result of coordination failures, incomplete understanding of the breach, or something harder to explain, is not a small detail._

  


**The attack unfolded across three distinct vectors.**  
  
First, [the compromised admin hot wallet was used to transfer 6,045,060 $H directly to an aggregation wallet on Ethereum](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852), no contract interaction required, just a key and a transfer.  
  
Second, three of the six stolen ETH Safe owner keys were assembled offline to cross the signing threshold, transfer ProxyAdmin ownership, upgrade the bridge to a malicious implementation, and [drain 141,182,632 $H in a single transaction](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852).  
  
Third, the same playbook executed on BSC - [three of five keys, same ProxyAdmin seizure, malicious implementation deployed, unlimited mint function activated.](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064281691016048761)

**[SlowMist's classification was precise:](https://hacked.slowmist.io/)**  Private Key Leakage.

  
**No audit would have caught this. No bug bounty program covers it. The contracts were not broken. The people responsible for the keys were.**

  
_When the architecture's only real defense is "the keys won't leak", and they do, what was the architecture actually defending?_  
  

### Print, Drain, and Exit  
  
_On June 8, someone used a key they had no right to hold [and moved 6,045,060 $H from the compromised admin hot wallet to an attacker-controlled wallet](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852)._  
  
**No contract interaction. No multisig ceremony. Just a stolen key and a transfer. [$H was trading at approximately $0.62 at the time.](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/humanity/historical_data)**

  
**Hot Wallet Drain:**
[0x94a4b4a37439ad5c01a84b504c7f58eb5c2ab560352f147f78e62802bf4ee015](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94a4b4a37439ad5c01a84b504c7f58eb5c2ab560352f147f78e62802bf4ee015)

  
That was the opening move. What followed was not improvisation.  
  

[Using three of the six Ethereum Safe owner keys, enough to cross the signing threshold, the attacker assembled an offline transaction](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852) and transferred ProxyAdmin ownership to a wallet they controlled.  
  
They then upgraded the bridge contract to a malicious implementation [and swept 141,182,632 $H in a single transaction](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852), raining the entire bridge contract in a single transaction.  
  

**ETH Bridge Drain:** [0xa665998ca9a2fcfe66d687647edede62c7acd554c7d35ea13c93788b8a129e5b](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa665998ca9a2fcfe66d687647edede62c7acd554c7d35ea13c93788b8a129e5b)

[On BSC, the same playbook was executed, with three of the five stolen Safe keys.](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064281691016048761) The ProxyAdmin was seized, the malicious implementation was deployed, and the unlimited mint function was activated.  
  
_[Then the attacker called mint() three times](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852), 100 million H per call._

Three hundred million tokens printed from nothing, [the figure confirmed by Humanity Protocol's own incident report](https://humanityprotocol.notion.site/H-Token-Incident-Update-37ab0ec467a781d7af06e7dcedd66852).

**[QuillAudits documented a far larger picture](https://x.com/QuillAudits_AI/status/2064340286374027613):** An additional 1,000,000,000 H minted in a single transaction, plus two further 100,000,000 H mints beyond the three the team confirmed, bringing the total BSC minting activity documented on-chain to approximately 1,500,000,000 H.

[QuillAudits documented substantially more on-chain](https://x.com/QuillAudits_AI/status/2064340281751978031), approximately 1,641,182,632 $H when including all BSC mint transactions the team has never accounted for.  
  

[What the attacker actually walked away with was $36 million](https://x.com/Humanityprot/status/2064281691016048761), the proceeds of dumping stolen and minted H tokens into their own selling pressure across decentralized exchanges only, never touching a centralized platform.

### Still Their Keys  
  
_[ZachXBT updated his position](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064227594632155390) on June 8th._  
  
**[After further analysis of the laundering trail](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064227594632155390), he concluded the market maker activity and the private key compromise appeared to be independent of one another.**  
  

**[ZachXBT](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064227594632155390):** "Kind of funny if the team was pumping the token for weeks only to have gotten rekt shortly before the upcoming unlock later this month."  
  

That walk-back was not an exoneration. [The demand to disclose active market maker agreements with a Hong Kong entity](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064191049267052853) remains publicly unanswered.  
  
The team has never addressed it.  
  

**[Weeks before the hack](https://cryptonews.net/news/altcoins/32761939/), the Humanity Foundation had already sent revised vesting terms to over 100 early investors, a binary choice between a 70% haircut for immediate liquidity on June 25, [or an extension of the cliff to September 2026 with quarterly distribution over three years](https://cryptonews.net/news/altcoins/32761939/).**

_**[ ](https://cryptonews.net/news/altcoins/32761939/)[One early backer, Ogle, wrote on Twitter](https://x.com/cryptogle/status/2064327971540722167):** "When a founding team treats its early backers with complete hostility as this one has, and disregards signed agreements, it's hard not to wonder what's actually going on behind the scenes of the company."_  
  

[Dr. Hakan Ünal, senior security operations lead at Cyvers, told CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/humanity-protocol-laptop-bridge-exploit-h-token) that the on-chain pattern can look similar whether an incident is a genuine compromise or a staged event, because the attacker holds legitimate admin rights in both cases.  
  
**“[What distinguishes them”, Dr. Ünal said, is the surrounding behavior](https://cointelegraph.com/news/humanity-protocol-laptop-bridge-exploit-h-token):** "A genuine compromise usually shows speed and improvisation: funds rushed to fresh wallets, swaps at bad prices, mixer use, and no insider timing. Right now the evidence is mixed, which is why the question is open."  
  

[Allium Labs research lead Elton Shehdula went further.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/humanity-protocol-laptop-bridge-exploit-h-token) His forensic analysis of the on-chain pattern concluded it was consistent with a potentially planned and coordinated operation rather than a lone opportunist.  
  
_[Attacker wallets were funded from an exchange and a mixer weeks in advance](https://cointelegraph.com/news/humanity-protocol-laptop-bridge-exploit-h-token). The minting authority was warmed up days before the attack. The dump executed across two chains simultaneously._  
  
**[Shehdula described the level of setup as consistent with either an insider or an outside actor](https://cointelegraph.com/news/humanity-protocol-laptop-bridge-exploit-h-token) who had quietly held the compromised key for some time.**  
  

[PeckShield published the most detailed on-chain forensics](https://t.me/peckshield/54468) of the pre-attack period on Telegram.

[The sending address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91844A3C6BDA5B1c1f663e2280F99896efe06F42) was later drained to [0xD1ea823D](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD1ea823D421E0c829ee11F772AF487fd352678EA), now labeled Humanity Protocol Exploiter 5 on Etherscan.

[PeckShield also traced a second large holder](https://t.me/peckshield/54468), who on May 28 sent a record 72 million $H (~$12M) to a wallet linked to a supposed market maker financier.

**[Peckshield mentioned that the activity of these addresses resembled that of a market maker operating](https://t.me/peckshield/54468) across several centralized exchanges.**  
  
**[PeckShield's conclusion was unambiguous](https://t.me/peckshield/54468):** "The protocol developer's keys, the market maker's financier keys, and the market maker's wallet keys can't all be on the same computer. Therefore, I'm certain this wasn't an attack. I'm certain this was a staged performance, which, at its core, is nothing less than a Rug Pull."  
  

[ZachXBT's laundering analysis arrived at a different conclusion](https://x.com/zachxbt/status/2064227594632155390), that the market maker activity and the hack were independent.  
  
But both investigators agreed on one thing: Something unusual was happening with Humanity Protocol's token before the exploit began.  
  

Then there is the question of the project itself.
