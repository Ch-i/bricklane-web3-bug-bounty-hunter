_Woo X got hit by a $14 million breach after a targeted phishing attack compromised a team member’s device - giving the attacker access to their development environment and, ultimately, hot wallets._

  

**WOO X's "[best-in-class security](https://woox.io/)" lasted about as long as ice cream in hell.**

  

Hackers went shopping across Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain and Arbitrum - turning WOO X into their personal treasury.

  

WOO X is now doing the usual song and dance - promising full compensation while their damage control team works overtime.

  

But here's what's really eating at people: this is the same crew connected to Kronos Research, [who got their API keys jacked for $26 million back in 2023](https://rekt.news/kronos-rekt).  
  
**And let's not forget [WooFi getting exploited for $8.5 million](https://rekt.news/woo-rekt) in March 2024 through a flash loan attack on their oracle system.**

  

_Lightning doesn't strike three times, but apparently bad OpSec does - so what's WOO X really running here, a crypto exchange or just the world's most expensive bug bounty for criminals?_

**Thursday morning, July 24th, started like any other day for WOO X users.**

  

By 2:09 PM UTC, it wasn't.

  

[WOO X dropped their first announcement](https://x.com/_WOO_X/status/1948400223761342920) with the kind of corporate speak that immediately makes your skin crawl: "We're currently investigating a contained incident that occurred on WOO X earlier today."

  

Contained incident. Right. Like calling the Titanic a minor shipping delay.

  

_Within the hour, the real story started leaking out. Nine user accounts had unauthorized withdrawals._

  

**The damage? A cool $14 million spread across multiple networks like butter on toast.**

  

But here's where it gets spicy - WOO X claimed they "quickly detected" the breach and blocked many withdrawals.

  

If their detection was so lightning-fast, how did $14 million still walk out the door?

  

**By 3:04 PM UTC, [Cyvers Alerts was doing WOO X's job for them](https://x.com/CyversAlerts/status/1948414103178924286), tracking the carnage in real-time while the exchange was still calling it a "[contained incident](https://x.com/_WOO_X/status/1948400223761342920)."**

  
_So when security firms are publishing your damage report while you're still calling it "contained," who's really running the damage control here?_

  

### The Damage Report

  

_The blockchain tells a different story than the press releases._

  

**While WOO X described "[user account](https://x.com/_WOO_X/status/1948403834406977748)" breaches, the on-chain data shows funds flowing directly from their hot wallets to attacker addresses across five different networks.**

[Their July 26th update compounds the confusion](https://x.com/_WOO_X/status/1949143037524705786) - compensating the '9 user account' losses from their 'company treasury.

**Here's the address trail...**  
  
On Ethereum, funds drained from WOO X's Ethereum hot wallet and scattered across four attacker addresses.

On Bitcoin, multiple withdrawals were coordinated from WOO X's Bitcoin hot wallet, distributed across five separate attacker addresses.

It was pretty straight forward on BSC. 5.03 BTCB tokens snatched from WOO's hot wallet on BSC.

 _Cyvers may be the only source [who caught the Tron component of this attack](https://x.com/CyversAlerts/status/1948415113406410945) (at least publicly)._

  

Rekt reached out to Meir Dolev, founder and CTO of Cyvers, who sent us the [attack transaction trace](https://intel.arkm.com/tracer/e2be99c9-13cb-475f-bf55-a735b26e224b), which confirmed 7 million TRX was stolen across two transactions.

Professional work. Someone knew exactly where WOO X kept their digital cash and helped themselves accordingly.

  

[Cyvers tracked the initial $12M estimate](https://x.com/CyversAlerts/status/1948414103178924286), but that number kept climbing.

  

**By the time WOO X finally admitted defeat, [they were staring at $14 million in confirmed losses](https://x.com/_WOO_X/status/1948422045760389330).**

  

_When hackers are operating across multiple blockchains simultaneously while your security team is still figuring out what happened, who's really running the show?_  
  
### How Did They Get In?  
  
_[WOO X eventually spilled the beans](https://x.com/_WOO_X/status/1948573397178339577) on how their 'best-in-class security' got schooled by a phishing attack._

  

**The phishing attack was simple but effective. A team member's device got compromised in a targeted attack.**

  
Once inside, the attackers gained access to WOO X's development environment - and that was game over.

  
The compromised development access gave them time to coordinate systematic withdrawals across multiple networks.

  

WOO X highlighted it as a "[contained incident](https://x.com/_WOO_X/status/1948400223761342920)" and how they "[quickly detected](https://x.com/_WOO_X/status/1948403834406977748)" everything.

  

_Yeah, right. Quick detection that still let $14 million walk out the door. That's like saying you quickly detected your house was on fire while it burned to the ground._

  

**Someone with the right access treated WOO X's system like their personal piggy bank.**

  

You don't accidentally drain funds across multiple networks - this was a planned shopping spree.

  

Speaking of planning, here's an interesting coincidence.

  

Two weeks before this mess, WOO X quietly paused [their bug bounty program](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/woox). No fanfare. No goodbye tweet.

  

**Just a [quiet notice in their Bugcrowd page](https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/woox): 'client asked to pause.' Strange timing, but these things happen.**

  

_The timing stinks, but the execution tells the real story - did someone already have backstage passes to this show?_

  

### The Illusion of Safety  
  

_[WOO X's homepage](https://woox.io/) reads like a checklist of every security buzzword known to man._

  

**"Best-in-class security." Check.
"ISO/IEC 27001 certified." Check.
"Enhanced asset security through leading custodians." Check.
"Active bug bounty program." Well, that aged like milk.**

  

They've got all the buzzwords and certificates money can buy.

  

[Their Proof of Reserves dashboard](https://woox.io/proof-of-reserves) shows $123.48 million in total assets - bump that to $169.32 million if you count their WOO tokens.

  

Look at all those pretty numbers.

  

_Security theater at its finest. All flash, zero substance._

  

**The [ISO certification](https://woox.io/) didn't stop $14 million from walking out.**

  

The "[leading custodians](https://woox.io/)" didn't prevent unauthorized withdrawals from their hot wallets.  
  
WOO X names [Fireblocks as their custodial partner](https://woo.org/blog/woo-x-integrating-leading-institutional-custody-technology-fireblocks) for institutional-grade custody.

  

**And that "active bug bounty program"? Well, they axed that two weeks before getting owned.**

  

They claim over 75% of user assets sit in custody or cold storage with 24/7 monitoring.

  

Sounds bulletproof on paper.

  

**Yet somehow, $14 million still walked out. So much for institutional-grade anything.**

  

_So what good is a certificate when the certifiers never saw this coming, and what's the point of bragging about custodial partnerships when your hot wallets are getting cleaned out?_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png)







_This isn't WOO X's first dance with disaster._

  

**Back in November 2023, their biggest market maker and incubator [Kronos Research got hammered for $25 million](https://rekt.news/kronos-rekt) after hackers grabbed their API keys.**

  

WOO X had to pause trading because Kronos was their primary liquidity provider - no liquidity, no trading, no bueno for anyone.

  

Then in March 2024, WooFi - the DeFi arm of the WOO Network - [got taken for $8.5 million](https://rekt.news/woo-rekt) through a flash loan attack that manipulated their oracle pricing system.

  

Three security failures across the WOO ecosystem in less than two years.

  

_Sound familiar? API compromise, oracle manipulation, development environment access - it's like watching the same security failures on repeat, just with different attack vectors._

  

**The pattern is getting embarrassing. First your main partner gets owned through API compromise.**

  

Then your DeFi protocol gets exploited through oracle manipulation.

  

Now your main exchange gets compromised through phishing and development environment access.

  

**When your security track record reads like a how-not-to guide, maybe it's time to ask - are some exchanges just honey pots with trading fees?**

  

Three strikes in two years. Kronos in 2023, WooFi in 2024, WOO X in 2025.

  
Is this a yearly ritual?  
  
But there's a bigger pattern here when it comes to the overall threat landscape.  
  
_Phishing attacks are becoming crypto's weapon of choice._

  

**While exchanges obsess over smart contract audits and cold storage protocols, hackers are just sending emails and messages to compromise the humans behind the keyboards.**

  

It's working better than any technical exploit.

  

WOO X will likely survive this. Especially if they pay back users, upgrade their systems, maybe bring in fresh security talent promising to transform their whole setup.

  

But here's what won't change: exchanges will keep spending millions on compliance theater while leaving their digital doors unlocked.

  

They'll keep trusting anonymous developers, poorly secured APIs, and access controls designed by people who apparently never heard of insider threats.

  

**The real tragedy isn't the $14 million that walked out the door - it's that in six months, we'll be writing the same story about a different exchange with the same security holes.**

  

_In an industry built on the promise of trustless systems, why do we keep trusting the least trustworthy people to guard the vault?_
