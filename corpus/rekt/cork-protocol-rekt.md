_Fake tokens just popped the Cork protocol for $12 million._

  

**The attacker deployed a counterfeit contract and manipulated Cork Protocol’s exchange rate calculations by abusing its fallback mechanisms and unchecked token interactions - turning the protocol’s assumptions into a devastating exploit.**

  

Cork's wstETH market got gutted by an exploit so surgically precise it made their security look like amateur hour.

  

While the team panic-paused contracts and tweeted damage control, thousands of wstETH were already converted and quietly moved out of the protocol.

  

Cork's smart contracts were supposed to compute exchange rates, not hand out free money to anyone with fake tokens and a calculator.

  

**The protocol learned that when you build your house on trust-but-don't-verify, eventually someone shows up with counterfeit keys.**

  

_If your exchange rate calculations can be gamed by fake tokens, who’s really in control?_

**Cork Protocol's Wednesday morning went sideways fast on May 28th.**

  

[Blockaid’s exploit detection system was triggered](https://x.com/blockaid_/status/1927696740091662541) - an attacker deployed fake token contracts to manipulate Cork Protocol’s exchange.

  

The attackers weren't subtle about it. Deploy malicious contract, manipulate exchange rates with fake tokens, drain 3,761 wstETH, convert to ETH, in a vicious one-two punch.

  

_[Cyvers was on the scene](https://x.com/CyversAlerts/status/1927701403092316254): A malicious contract was deployed by an address likely funded by a service provider._
  
**Funding Wallet:**
[0x47713cb34fabd63b39d7c5c6f675dca39d22762b](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47713cb34fabd63b39d7c5c6f675dca39d22762b)

  

[MistTrack identified the exploiter](https://x.com/MistTrack_io/status/1927711348932198808) and [traced the gas fees back to Swapuz](https://light.misttrack.io/address/ETH/0xEA6f30e360192bae715599E15e2F765B49E4da98), a supposed “service provider.”

  

Phil Fogel, Cork's co-founder, [delivered the inevitable damage control tweet](https://x.com/Philfog/status/1927704265423757321): "We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information."

  

**Shortly after, [Cork confirmed what everyone already knew](https://x.com/Corkprotocol/status/1927716837271261621) - the damage was clear: $12 million in wstETH had vanished, converted to ETH faster than Cork's team could tweet "we're investigating."**  
  
_When the system can’t tell fake from real, how does an attacker turn counterfeit contracts into cold, hard ETH?_

  

### The Anatomy of a Fake Token Heist  
  
_So how do you turn counterfeit contracts into $12 million in real assets?_

  

**According to security researchers, the exploit wasn't rocket science - just weaponized arithmetic and a protocol that couldn't tell fake tokens from real ones.**

  

The attacker's playbook was elegantly simple: deploy fake token contracts, feed them into Cork's exchange rate calculations, and watch the protocol's fallback logic hand over the keys to the kingdom.

  

[Dedaub cut straight to the chase](https://x.com/dedaub/status/1927719524490481823): "The root cause appears to be an issue in the way an exchange rate is computed. The attacker manipulated this by deploying fake tokens - the protocol contained logic to revert to a default value."  
  
[Lei Wu from BlockSec pinpointed](https://x.com/realvisual/status/1927741755400884661) the exact failure: "It appears that the protocol fails to properly verify the arguments passed to the CorkCall function, allowing the attacker to specify a fake paymentToken and profit from it."

  

_[William Li broke down the exploit](https://x.com/hklst4r/status/1927755386557255717) like a magician revealing the sleight of hand._

  

**The attacker didn't crack Cork's code - they played by the rules, just better than Cork did.**

Cork allowed users to create markets with arbitrary redemption assets (RA) through the CorkConfig contract. The attacker exploited this by setting DS tokens from a legitimate market as the RA in their fake market.

The exploit hinged on two critical flaws: Cork's CorkHook contract's beforeSwap function could be called by any user without authorization, and it accepted custom hook data for CorkCall operations.

[They created a fake market](https://x.com/hklst4r/status/1927791271265108328) where a real DS token from the original market was treated as a base asset (RA). Cork's system never questioned it.

  

_The attacker manipulated the protocol by [depositing valid DS tokens from a legitimate market into their new market as RA](https://x.com/hklst4r/status/1927791271265108328), receiving the corresponding DS and CT tokens in return._

  

**Imagine a vending machine that gives you chips for inserting a fake chip bag - because it doesn't care what goes in, only that something does.**

  

With those newly minted fake tokens, the attacker cycled back into the system, redeemed them through the legit PSM, and walked away with real wstETH.

  

Free tokens in, real assets out. A depeg insurance protocol undone by a logic depeg.

  

**The protocol's mathematical assumptions met reality - and reality had fake tokens and a calculator.**

  

_But when you've just printed yourself $12 million in freshly minted ETH, where exactly do you take it to cash out?_

  

### Following the Digital Breadcrumbs

  

_Every blockchain heist leaves a trail - the trick is following it before it disappears into the crypto washing machine._

**Exploit Transaction 1:**
[0xfd89cdd0be468a564dd525b222b728386d7c6780cf7b2f90d2b54493be09f64d](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfd89cdd0be468a564dd525b222b728386d7c6780cf7b2f90d2b54493be09f64d)

**Exploit Transaction 2 (Main theft):**
[0x605e653fb580a19f26dfa0a6f1366fac053044ac5004e1b10e7901b058150c50 ](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x605e653fb580a19f26dfa0a6f1366fac053044ac5004e1b10e7901b058150c50)

**Transaction [tracing on Metasleuth here](https://metasleuth.io/result/eth/0xea6f30e360192bae715599e15e2f765b49e4da98?source=6a702ebe-195f-4a8e-b287-a1f9701f9f2e).**

  

_The attacker's methodology was textbook crypto crime 101: convert stolen assets into something liquid, move fast, leave no forwarding address._

  

All 3,761 wstETH got converted to ETH in a series of rapid-fire transactions - because when you're running a heist, stablecoins and blue chips don't ask awkward questions.

  

Professional preparation for a professional payout.

  

**As of the last check, the stolen funds were still [sitting pretty in the attacker's wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xea6f30e360192bae715599e15e2f765b49e4da98) - $12 million in ETH just waiting for its next move.**

  

_Did the attacker just get lucky - or were they already watching Cork's every move?_

  

### Audit Blindspot  
  
_Cork Protocol wasn't some fly-by-night operation running unaudited code in the wild._

  

**They had the [full security theater package](https://docs.cork.tech/smart-contracts/v1/audits): audits from [Quantstamp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ma-WMbiy5QS_aW4ySqGbyjyx6KHYXlzI/view), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/2858a0dd-503c-4e73-9e67-165fe6b99714), [Sherlock](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XiDqE0Pj7W7L2xmxR1Q7mSI32aXGgEe6/view), and [Runtime Verification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1snmZ1d3JU8He0L42rD6yybCGQdrPxSjV/view) - four different firms, multiple rounds of reviews, even a [bug bounty through Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/bounties/7e55cc61-e96c-4bda-a324-25b44d45e171), all the badges and certifications a DeFi protocol could want.**

  

At least three of the four audit firms - Sherlock, Runtime Verification, and Quantstamp - had the vulnerable CorkHook contract outside their defined scope.

  

Only Cantina's scope boundaries remain unclear, but somehow a critical input validation flaw in the core hook mechanism slipped through four separate security reviews.

  

But as more details began to emerge, one thing stood out loud and clear.

  

_[Sherlock’s team pointed out](https://t.me/ETHSecurity/130589): "The exploit involves the CorkHook contract which we didn't audit."_

  

**Out of scope. The three most expensive words in DeFi security.**
  
The [recent exploit breakdown by Three Sigma](https://x.com/threesigmaxyz/status/1928048350189793678) revealed that Runtime Verification clarified their constraints: "This was a time-constrained verification effort, which means we had to make assumptions to handle the desired scope. Creating markets was a permissioned process at the time of verification. Verification of hook functions was out of scope, again due to time constraints."

  

The vulnerability wasn't lurking in some cryptographic labyrinth or hiding behind advanced math - it was sitting in code marked 'out of scope' due to time constraints and audit boundaries.

  

**Cantina's audit specifically focused on input validation flaws, finding multiple instances where Cork failed to verify tokens properly - yet the critical vulnerability went undetected.**
  
Maybe Cork's inevitable post-mortem will explain how four security firms managed to collectively miss the front door while checking every window.

  

Cork burned months and serious cash getting their contracts rubber-stamped by premium auditors, then watched $12 million evaporate through the one door nobody checked.

  

**Four audits. Four firms. One gaping hole where the CorkHook contract should have been reviewed.**

  

_When your audit coverage has more gaps than a hockey player's smile, who's really protecting whom?_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png)


_Fake tokens just taught Cork Protocol that trust-but-don't-verify is a $12 million philosophy._

  

**The attacker didn't need zero-days or advanced cryptography - just counterfeit contracts and a protocol dumb enough to treat every token like a VIP at the vault door.**

  

Cork's CorkHook contract became a validation-free zone dispensing fake tokens to anyone smart enough to call beforeSwap with malicious parameters, while four separate audit firms somehow missed the one piece of code that actually mattered.

  

The protocol that wanted to insure users against depeg events couldn't insure themselves against fake tokens and missing input validation.

  

**Cork learned that premium auditors and institutional backing mean nothing when your core functions don't verify what tokens they're actually processing.**

  

_When your depeg insurance protocol gets depegged from reality by fake tokens, who's insuring the insurers?_
