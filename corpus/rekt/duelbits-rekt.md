_Loss: $6,070,000_  
_Incident date: 9/24/2026_  
_Pre-exploit audit: N/A_  

> An attacker moved ~$6.07 million from Duelbits' hot wallets across five chains in a suspected private-key compromise, including the replacement wallet named after its $4.6 million theft in 2024. It reopened days later, cause still undisclosed. What changed since 2024?

_[Duelbits replaced its Ethereum hot wallet](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/1758159522533634149) after [a $4.6 million theft in 2024](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1757681640384381238)._  
  
**On September 24, 2026, assets traced from Duelbits-linked hot wallets across five chains were worth an estimated $6.07 million.**  
  
Among the affected wallets was the Ethereum hot wallet Duelbits had publicly named after the 2024 breach.

Duelbits co-founder [Joe put the loss at roughly $7 million](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103116878986010688).  
  
Investigators [traced outflows on Ethereum, BNB Chain and Tron](https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2103059906303869042) and [identified receiving addresses on Bitcoin and Solana](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/2103087561963110552).  
  
The transfers documented across those five chains amount to approximately $6.1 million at the prices used in this analysis; they do not independently reconcile the full amount Joe reported.

_[Scam Sniffer described the outflows as a suspected](https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2103059906303869042) private-key compromise._  
  
**[Joe promised an explanation within 24 hours](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103252719217627325) and projected a quick reopening.**  
  
[Joe said the site would remain offline longer while Duelbits secured its systems and replenished its wallets](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103552269878743340). On September 27, [Duelbits announced it had reopened](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2104074754701611398), with deposits and withdrawals enabled.

**In an [April 5, 2026 blog post](https://duelbits.com/blog/guide/is-duelbits-legit/), Duelbits wrote under “Track record”:** “Duelbits has operated since 2020. No security breaches, hacks, or unauthorised fund access incidents have been reported in that time.”  
  
The claim contradicted [Duelbits’ own February 2024 acknowledgment that its Ethereum hot wallet had suffered a “security breach” resulting in an “unauthorized withdrawal.”](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/1758159522533634149)

**That contradiction makes the earlier breach more than background: it raises questions about what Duelbits changed afterward.**

_What did Duelbits change after the first theft, and how did an attacker gain the ability to move funds from its replacement wallet?_

**At 08:58 UTC on September 24, [476,058 USDT moved from a Tron wallet](https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/2793e4b8ab5f8abc3bc461ba45b19d2ea247831be8afb6d1e8068e81ad2a9e2d) that [Scam Sniffer identified as belonging to Duelbits](https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2103059906303869042).**  
  
At 08:59 UTC, [552,762 USDT left a Duelbits hot wallet on BNB Chain](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0a79ed0be9a608f623bb1e12d2e8e811237d0c87b396373f7d6f1aa1f78bb885). Duelbits had [announced the same wallet address as its new Ethereum hot wallet](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/1758159522533634149) after the 2024 breach

**Transfers followed from that wallet on Ethereum:** [593,430 USDT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4f2bc2a8bc5040788c71e712546deec6d0f61529518b8114b0334ffd3e9bb739), [96,805 USDC](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf9cd780608100fad136e4cb9a334c4faa6cd4fd4f0007bd4b6334ba71128eedf), [31,515 DAI](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9ded7a9c5a4d1f4f1aa06d972bb423ce5f186d436d229727a185b4279d4fd746) and [about 12.4 billion SHIB](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0ef345e1d19cfef9e46517b5d7d9dba2c25893a90f548a92dc964cdab1caf3f7). The wallet then sent [836 ETH at 09:02:47 UTC](https://eth.blockscout.com/tx/0xcdc0b6dfacbefe4aef640be1538c9081bbf401ca9ad9784e1b0cfc044523182d).  
  
The three identified USDT transfers across Tron, BNB Chain and Ethereum total approximately $1.62 million USDT, [the amount Scam Sniffer later cited.](https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2103059906303869042)

_At 09:42 UTC, [8.09987887 BTC reached](https://mempool.space/tx/159e274755432366d2589ef7ed809c440b262ed2e23277ca8d4a2bcd506bf221) an [address identified in the investigation by Specter](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/2103069111664402843)._  
  
**At 9:52 UTC, [Scam Sniffer reported roughly $4.2 million in outflows from Duelbits hot wallets on Ethereum, BNB Chain and Tron](https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2103059906303869042), calling it a suspected private-key compromise.**

The estimates that followed covered different points in the investigation.  
  
At 10:15, [PeckShield estimated approximately $4.3 million on Ethereum and BNB Chain](https://x.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/2103065687799570775) and said the assets it tracked had been swapped into 1,587.87 ETH and 31,500 DAI.  
  
_At 10:28, [Specter put the total at about $4.9 million after including more than $600,000](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/2103069111664402843) in Bitcoin; [Scam Sniffer reached a similar estimate](https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2103086211787325547) in an update that counted about 8.1 BTC._  
  
**At 11:42, [CertiK flagged roughly $6 million in suspicious outflows](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/2103087558519624189) and pointed back to the [approximately $4.6 million incident it had reported in February 2024](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1757681640384381238).**

Also at 11:42, [Duelbits said it was investigating "a security incident" and had taken the site offline as a precaution](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2103087620104323369).  
  
Its post gave no loss figure or explanation of how the funds had been accessed, two hours and 44 minutes after the first identified transfer.

[Co-founder Joe said Duelbits would return "asap"](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103103067013218385) at 12:43 UTC.  
  
**At 13:38, [he confirmed "a ~$7M hack"](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103116878986010688), said the team was "still investigating exactly what happened and how," and asserted that user funds were safe.**  
  
[His stated next steps included launching Duelbits 2.0](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103116878986010688), an [upgrade he had promoted two days earlier](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2102511105092342113).

Those figures were successive estimates, not a reconciled tally.  
  
**Duelbits did not provide a chain-by-chain accounting or publicly explain how the attacker gained access in those September 24 statements.**

_If Duelbits had not explained the access route, what could the drained address itself reveal?_

### Return Address

_Scam Sniffer [described the September 2026 outflows as a "suspected private key compromise"](https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2103059906303869042)._

**[SlowMist lists "Private Key Leakage"](https://hacked.slowmist.io/) as the incident's attack method.**  
  
Those assessments do not, on their own, establish that a private key was extracted.  
  
The transfers document the movement of funds, not how the attacker gained the ability to move them.

The identified [Tron](https://tronscan.org/transaction/2793e4b8ab5f8abc3bc461ba45b19d2ea247831be8afb6d1e8068e81ad2a9e2d/overview), [BNB Chain](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0a79ed0be9a608f623bb1e12d2e8e811237d0c87b396373f7d6f1aa1f78bb885) and [Ethereum](https://eth.blockscout.com/tx/0xcdc0b6dfacbefe4aef640be1538c9081bbf401ca9ad9784e1b0cfc044523182d) transfers show funds moving out across multiple networks. Their timing does not reveal where or how access began.

_Later on September 24, [Joe said Duelbits had "identified what happened" and promised an official statement within 24 hours](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103252719217627325). He said the company was rebuilding its deposit and withdrawal servers "to make sure everything is 100% secure." "A few people ruined it for everyone else," he added, without identifying them or explaining their role._

**The missing explanation matters because this was not the first reported theft. In February 2024, [CertiK estimated that roughly $4.6 million had been taken from Duelbits and described a private-key compromise as possible](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1757681640384381238).**

[Duelbits subsequently acknowledged that its ETH hot wallet had suffered a "security breach" resulting in an "unauthorized withdrawal"](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/1758159495807541459) and [publicly named a new ETH hot wallet](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/1758159522533634149).

That replacement address is the one identified in the September 2026 [Ethereum](https://eth.blockscout.com/tx/0xcdc0b6dfacbefe4aef640be1538c9081bbf401ca9ad9784e1b0cfc044523182d) and [BNB Chain](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0a79ed0be9a608f623bb1e12d2e8e811237d0c87b396373f7d6f1aa1f78bb885) transfers.  
  
**The address match does not establish that the same attacker, credentials or access route were involved. It does make what Duelbits changed after the first breach a central unanswered question.**  
  
It does make what Duelbits changed after the first breach a central unanswered question. [Duelbits claimed in April 2026 that no breach had been reported since it began operating in 2020](https://duelbits.com/blog/guide/is-duelbits-legit/), despite [acknowledging a breach of its Ethereum hot wallet in February 2024](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/1758159522533634149).  
  
That contradiction makes an account of what changed, and what failed, more important.

**The access route remains unverified. The subsequent movement of the funds is more visible.**

_Duelbits hasn't said how the funds got out, so what does the chain show about where they went?_

### Cashing Out

_The identified Ethereum and BNB Chain transfers went to one recipient._

**[CertiK also flagged receiving addresses on Tron, Bitcoin and Solana](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/2103087561963110552), but the addresses alone did not establish how much each received.**  
  
The transaction listings examined for this piece put the Ethereum and BNB Chain assets in one wallet, the Tron and Solana assets in separate wallets, and an approximately 8.1 BTC output at the flagged Bitcoin address.

_The Bitcoin transaction combined 121 inputs.

Most of the funds did not remain in their original assets. [PeckShield said the Ethereum and BNB Chain assets it tracked had been swapped into 1,587.87 ETH and 31,500 DAI](https://x.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/2103065687799570775).  
  
The DAI moved later; [The Defiant reported that an intermediary converted 31,515 DAI into about 11.78 ETH after fees](https://thedefiant.io/news/hacks/duelbits-co-founder-reports-7-million-hack-as-casino-stays-offline).

**[Duelbits announced they had reopened on September 26th](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2104074754701611398). But reopening the platform did not, by itself, settle what had happened to the funds.**  
  
_What, exactly, did that relaunch establish?_

### Topped Up

_Duelbits' recovery plan had four steps, as [Joe listed them on day one](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103116878986010688): Finish the investigation, re-top hot wallets, bring the site back, launch Duelbits 2.0._

**[Duelbits said it had re-topped the hot wallets](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2103816082326995049), and [announced the site was back](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2104074754701611398), later than promised.**  
  
No findings from the investigation have been published so far, and [Duelbits was still describing 2.0 as forthcoming when it reopened](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2104074754701611398).

At 22:38 UTC on September 24, [Joe said the site should be back within about 15 hours](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103252719217627325). He told followers to "ignore the FUD" and promised Duelbits would be "back stronger than ever."

The next morning, [the official Duelbits account said it was still offline for "final security checks"](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2103444716159455314) and promised a more detailed update "very soon."

_By that afternoon, [Joe was apologizing for more downtime](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103552269878743340). The team was topping up hot and cold wallets, and [players would be able to withdraw immediately once the site returned](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103552269878743340), he said. [Also mentioning Duelbits 2.0 was penciled in for early October](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103552269878743340)._

**The next evening on September 25, [Joe identified three wallets he said would be used to restock the hot wallets, describing the funding as roughly $8 million](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103631823087509694).**

_Publishing funding wallets is a step toward transparency. It is not proof of reserves. Those addresses identify wallets Duelbits said would fund operations; they do not show what the platform owes players._

**[At 05:04 UTC on September 27, Duelbits was back](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2104074754701611398). Deposits and withdrawals were live, the team had taken "the extra time to rebuild and test everything properly," and, Duelbits said, around $8 million sat across hot and cold wallets, "ready to pay out."**

**[Players were told](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2104074754701611398):** “Deposit addresses have changed. Always get your new one from your account.”  
  
The official statement [Joe had promised within 24 hours on September 24](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103252719217627325) still had not materialized when the site reopened; [in a follow-up statement on September 27, where Joe stated that he was](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2104290168744169900) “working on an official explanation,” then argued that attention arrives only when “stuff hits the fan.”  
  
As of October 2nd, no public root-cause report or chain-by-chain accounting has been released to the public.  
  
_What players do have are assurances. [Joe](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103116878986010688) and [the official account](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2103444716159455314) both said user funds were safe._

**[In an April 2026 blog post](https://duelbits.com/blog/guide/is-duelbits-legit/), Duelbits claimed player crypto sits in "offline, air-gapped wallets" and that the casino "maintains reserves sufficient to cover all player balances."**

[The same page said no breaches had been reported](https://duelbits.com/blog/guide/is-duelbits-legit/) since 2020.

[Except Duelbits had reported a breach in February 2024](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/1758159522533634149), Duelbits publicly announced that it was replacing its Ethereum hot wallet after [attackers stole roughly $4.6 million](https://x.com/CertiKAlert/status/1757681640384381238).  
  
[The April 2026 post therefore presented a record](https://duelbits.com/blog/guide/is-duelbits-legit/) that conflicted with Duelbits’ own public disclosures.  
  
**As somebody that spends the majority of their time not trusting, but rather verifying, this makes my skin crawl.**

_If reopening shows Duelbits is back in business, what shows it learned anything from the last time?_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png)


_Two thefts, one replacement address, and still no public account of what changed in between._

**Duelbits did the visible work quickly.**  
  
[They took the site offline](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2103087620104323369), [posted wallets intended to replenish its hot wallets](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103631823087509694), and [said it had reopened with about $8 million across hot and cold storage](https://x.com/Duelbits/status/2104074754701611398).  
  
What it has not shown is how the attacker gained the ability to move funds from the replacement address.

**[Security researchers suspect a private-key compromise](https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/2103059906303869042), but Duelbits has not disclosed the cause. The [explanation Joe promised within 24 hours](https://x.com/DuelbitsJoe/status/2103252719217627325), still has yet to manifest as of October 2nd.**

**That is the record players are left to reconcile:** A company publicly responding to breaches while its own marketing page says they never happened.  
  
**The gap is not merely what Duelbits has yet to explain, but what its own public record still asks players to overlook.**  
  
_If a casino makes every roll verifiable, why is its security history the one thing players are expected to take on faith?_
