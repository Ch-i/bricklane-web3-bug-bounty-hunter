# Aevo - Rekt

_Loss: $2,700,000_  
_Incident date: 12/12/2025_  
_Pre-exploit audit: N/A_  

> Dead code still bleeds. Aevo, formerly known as Ribbon Finance, took a $2.7 million hit on old vaults. A proxy admin vulnerability enabled a full oracle hijack, allowing the attacker to rig prices to infinity and drain the old contract in one atomic loop.

_Six days, that was the exact shelf life of Aevo’s latest oracle upgrade before it turned their legacy Ribbon vaults into a public donation bin._

  

**On December 12, [the protocol bled $2.7 million](https://x.com/ribbonfinance/status/1999815546007584817), not through a complex cryptographic failure, but [because of an upgrade that accidentally removed the lock from the front door](https://x.com/antonttc/status/1999696276234076659).**

  

This allowed the attacker to [simply ask the oracle to set the price of assets to arbitrary, astronomical levels](https://x.com/lzhou1110/status/1999673530661945702), and the contract obliged.

  

This wasn't a case of neglected code gathering dust, [but another example of incremental upgrades where the design choices made earlier were ignored](https://x.com/antonttc/status/1999696276234076659).

  

**While the team focused on their new exchange, their digital attic was ransacked by someone who noticed the security controls had been updated to "optional."**

  

_When a routine patch turns a legacy vault into an open checkbook, is it really an exploit, or just an involuntary feature release?_

**It was supposed to be maintenance.**  
  
To understand the negligence angle, you have to understand the architecture.  
  
Ribbon Finance was the OG of DeFi options, but in [July 2023, the DAO voted to merge into Aevo](https://gov.ribbon.finance/t/rgp-33-merge-ribbon-finance-into-aevo/709), unifying the brands and folding Ribbon’s structured products into Aevo’s suite.  
  
This wasn't a deprecation; it was a unification.  
  
_[The governance proposal](https://gov.ribbon.finance/t/rgp-33-merge-ribbon-finance-into-aevo/709) explicitly approved "folding Ribbon Finance into Aevo's suite of structured products," rebranding the Ethereum-based vaults and integrating them as the core L1 vertical of Aevo's "DeFi Super-App" vision._  
  
**But rebranding the vaults didn't make them bulletproof - it just meant a single clumsy update was enough to leave the platform's bedrock defenseless.**

  

On December 6, [the Aevo team pushed an upgrade to the oracle configuration for their Ribbon vaults](https://www.theblock.co/post/382461/aevos-legacy-ribbon-dov-vaults-exploited-for-2-7-million-following-oracle-upgrade). The goal may have been standard operational housekeeping. The result was the digital equivalent of unscrewing the hinges from the bank vault.

  

The [upgrade inadvertently exposed the price-feed proxies](https://x.com/lzhou1110/status/1999673530661945702?s=20), leaving [critical functions like transferOwnership and setImplementation completely unprotected](https://x.com/lzhou1110/status/1999673540283601226).

  

For six days, the contract sat there, waiting for anyone with a block explorer and a lack of morals to notice. On December 12, someone finally did.

  

_The attacker didn't need to outsmart the market or manipulate liquidity depth. They simply promoted themselves to admin._  
  
**[Specter flagged the carnage while the body was still warm](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/1999532982411854109), identifying the exploit contract and the initial outflows long before Aevo announced the hack themselves.**  
  
It took Aevo until the cold light of the next morning to catch up. [Nearly 19 hours after the heist began, the protocol finally broke their silence](https://x.com/ribbonfinance/status/1999815546007584817), tweeting a confirmation that their legacy vaults had been "exploited following a vulnerability in a smart contract update" - corporate speak for admitting they broke their own lock.

  

[Researcher Liyi Zhou](https://x.com/lzhou1110/status/1999673530661945702) and [former Opyn dev Anton Cheng](https://x.com/antonttc/status/1999696266973036848) dissected the mechanics.

  

**The [attack began with a specific setup transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9b686c9d9532f224b84825d5b6c8a8c27811a33de4b0f20204aafd288304ab54), where the exploiter minted a financial Frankenstein: options collateralized by wstETH, but chemically bonded to AAVE as the underlying asset.**

  

[Under Opyn’s original Gamma protocol design, this shouldn't have been a problem](https://x.com/antonttc/status/2000234581094736093). The protocol enforces strict matching rules to ensure full collateralization. Opyn wasn’t broken.

  

But Ribbon’s "upgraded" configuration [didn’t follow those rules](https://x.com/antonttc/status/1999696280050970760).

  

The flawed upgrade didn't break the rules, it rewrote them. [According to William Li’s analysis](https://x.com/hklst4r/status/1999661564647882859), it allowed the attacker to legally whitelist arbitrary products, turning the creation of malicious markets into a valid protocol action.  
  
_But the real damage came from how they abused the upgradeable price-feed proxies._

**The upgrade didn't just tweak the math, it [created a fatal misalignment between the protocol's past and present](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-aevo-ribbon-finance-hack-december-2025). While the new configuration supported 18 decimals, many older assets on the platform still used 8 decimals.**

Worse, the proxy-based oracle stack included a [critical access control vulnerability](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-aevo-ribbon-finance-hack-december-2025). It inadvertently [permitted anyone to set expiry prices for newly-created assets](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-aevo-ribbon-finance-hack-december-2025).

The attacker didn't need to outsmart the market, they just needed to exploit this math error.

[As detailed by security firm Halborn](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-aevo-ribbon-finance-hack-december-2025), the attacker executed the drain by creating an arithmetic monstrosity: options products that exploited the decimal precision gap.

_The attacker spun up short-fuse options with strike prices buried deep below market value. By mixing 18-decimal assets with 8-decimal relics, they turned a precision error into a precision weapon._

**For example, the attacker created an [stETH call option with a strike price of 3,800 USDC (8-decimal)](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-aevo-ribbon-finance-hack-december-2025), collateralized by WETH (18-decimal), and [created oTokens from these](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-aevo-ribbon-finance-hack-december-2025).**

When these options expired on December 12, the system's broken logic - confused by the precision mismatch - calculated that the current value of stETH was astronomically higher than the 3,800 USDC strike.

The result was a money printer. In one instance, [the attacker burned just 225 oTokens to drain approximately 22.46 WETH](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-aevo-ribbon-finance-hack-december-2025).They rinsed and repeated the process until the vaults were empty.

**The underlying protocol worked exactly as code is intended to work. It was Ribbon’s configuration that essentially handed the attacker a loaded gun and pointed it at their own treasury.**

  

_Now that the vault was open and the prices were rigged, the only question remained: how fast could they empty it?_  
  
### The Loot Trail  
  

_This wasn't a clumsy smash-and-grab. It was an ice cold execution._  
  
**[Specter’s analysis reveals a professional operation](https://x.com/SpecterAnalyst/status/1999532982411854109), and maybe not a lone gunman. Some security reports might flag one exploiter, but on-chain flows show an org chart with a distinct separation of roles.**

**Phase 1 - The Setup:** The Mastermind funded the infrastructure, but stayed out of the blast radius. Clean hands from dirty money. Instead of direct involvement, they seeded a network of wallets to assemble the weaponry.

The Specialist (0xCf5DF51A10c097140FB3a367281A4f5313725b1F) was activated to forge the "Frankenstein" option contract - a poisoned derivative designed to weaponize decimal precision.  
  

The Engineer (0x9c619915fda0db49d6ec7b4224537acb872731ca) was funded to deploy the malicious oracle logic.  
  

_The Bagman (0x4BFD5C65082171DF83fd0fBBe54aa74909529b2c) was deployed to serve as the mule that would physically interact with the vault._  
  

**The Mastermind (Funder):**  
[0x4c0dc529C4252e7Be0Db8D00592e04f878e4F397](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4c0dc529c4252e7be0db8d00592e04f878e4f397)

**The Specialist (Frankenstein Deployer - Note: This wallet was later reused as a money mule in Phase 4):**  
[0xCf5DF51A10c097140FB3a367281A4f5313725b1F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf5df51a10c097140fb3a367281a4f5313725b1f)

**The Frankenstein Contract (Malicious Option Instrument):** [0x8eccacbc1147fc7edc52bae135bd54f5f1950255](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8eccacbc1147fc7edc52bae135bd54f5f1950255#internaltx)

**The Frankenstein Creation Transaction(Executed by The Specialist):**  
[0x9b686c9d9532f224b84825d5b6c8a8c27811a33de4b0f20204aafd288304ab54](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9b686c9d9532f224b84825d5b6c8a8c27811a33de4b0f20204aafd288304ab54)

**The Engineer (Oracle Weapon Deployer):**  
[0x9c619915fda0db49d6ec7b4224537acb872731ca ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9c619915fda0db49d6ec7b4224537acb872731ca)

**The Engineer’s Weapon (The malicious implementation contract. It contained the code that bypassed security checks and executed the unauthorized oracle updates):**  
[0xE1f09d50F733993b11bF3054bD870d688401984c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe1f09d50f733993b11bf3054bd870d688401984c)

  
**The Bagman (Exploit Executor Contract - This contract is what actually interacted with the vault to receive the stolen funds):**  
[0x4BFD5C65082171DF83fd0fBBe54aa74909529b2c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4BFD5C65082171DF83fd0fBBe54aa74909529b2c)

_Another crucial role in the setup belonged to a player we will dub The Fall Guy - This wallet was deployed to establish the "Disguise."  It executed a sequence of white-glove transactions - whitelisting collateral, deploying a clean Oracle - manufacturing a history of compliance to mask the impending hit._

  

**This wasn't just a setup, it was a Trojan Horse. By establishing a resume of valid interaction, the Fall Guy ensured that when the malicious script finally ran, the protocol’s defenses didn't see an enemy. They saw the boss.**

  
**The Fall Guy:**  
[0xb594f7e7ad548f63db49665ae4e3d3f8457cf6f5](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb594f7e7ad548f63db49665ae4e3d3f8457cf6f5)

  
**Disguised PriceFeedOracle:**  
[0xF2Df028a81682375b27967d6de36ADA049cBDFf7](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf2df028a81682375b27967d6de36ada049cbdff7)

**The Disguised PriceFeedOracle was created in this Transaction:**  
[0x7182dcc5fe69c888dbf929794c2b19450035b4e11b318218d531acea1aa31e31](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7182dcc5fe69c888dbf929794c2b19450035b4e11b318218d531acea1aa31e31)

**Phase 2 - The Hijack:** The kill shot came with a single transaction that rewrote the oracle’s reality. [Researcher Liyi Zhou identified the weapon](https://x.com/lzhou1110/status/1999673530661945702) - a contract hammering the Proxy Admin (0x9D7b) to execute transferOwnership and setImplementation at will.  
  
**Proxy Admin:**  
[0x9D7b3586f361e3621Bf4F099cBC9d155e8ae6B76](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9d7b3586f361e3621bf4f099cbc9d155e8ae6b76)

_Crucially, this wasn't a brute-force assault. It was a VIP entry. [Technical analysis of the Proxy Admin reveals a fatal logic flaw](https://x.com/Zyy_0530/status/1999680528036012087): the transferOwnership function didn't verify the contract calling it, but simply checked for a permission flag on tx.origin._

  

**The Fall Guy wallet possessed this flag. The system didn't surrender because it was overwhelmed; it surrendered because it recognized the attacker as the boss.**  
  
Armed with this silent authorization, the attacker triggered the sequence.

  

Using the Attack Contract as a proxy, they executed a looping script that abused this access in real-time. For each asset, the script swapped the oracle implementation to the Engineer’s Weapon, forced an arbitrary price update, and immediately swapped back to the legitimate contract to mask the intrusion.  
  

**Oracle Manipulation Transaction:** [0xb73e45948f4aabd77ca888710d3685dd01f1c81d24361d4ea0e4b4899d490e1e](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb73e45948f4aabd77ca888710d3685dd01f1c81d24361d4ea0e4b4899d490e1e#eventlog)

The manipulation wasn't subtle. In a single fatal transaction, the attacker swapped the oracle to point at the Engineer's Weapon. This malicious code overwrote the oracle's reality, cranking the AAVE price to infinity and locking the expiry timestamp to [1765526400 (Dec 12, 2025)](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb73e45948f4aabd77ca888710d3685dd01f1c81d24361d4ea0e4b4899d490e1e#eventlog#171).  
  
**Phase 3 - The Drain:** With the timeline hacked and prices rigged to god-mode, the protocol didn't just enable the theft - it executed the drain with the cold efficiency of a compliant machine.

_The Bagman contract immediately began the extraction. In the primary drain transaction, it burned the Frankenstein oTokens to trigger a massive payout of 846 WETH and 178k USDC from the victim vault._  
  
**The Bagman Contract:**  
[0x4BFD5C65082171DF83fd0fBBe54aa74909529b2c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4BFD5C65082171DF83fd0fBBe54aa74909529b2c)

**The Compromised Vault (Victim):**  
[0x3c212A044760DE5a529B3Ba59363ddeCcc2210bE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3c212a044760de5a529b3ba59363ddeccc2210be)

**Primary Drain Transaction (Confirmed by Specter trace: The Bagman burns oTokens -> Victim sends ~$2.6M in assets):** [0x16eded2553e0793472a6283093738152de1dd0e2504836856fbcaf88cc4a2687](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x16eded2553e0793472a6283093738152de1dd0e2504836856fbcaf88cc4a2687)

**Address that Conducted the Drain:**  
[0x657CDEfc7ef8b459b519dEFc8BED2A67d3cC1aAb](https://etherscan.io/address/0x657cdefc7ef8b459b519defc8bed2a67d3cc1aab)

**Phase 4 - The Getaway:** Once the protocol was drained, the funds didn't stay put. They were moved to a Distributor wallet, which then blasted them out to a laundry list of theft addresses in precise 100.1 ETH batches (99 + 1 + 0.1) to prep for Tornado Cash.  
  

**The Distributor (Consolidator):**

**Clearly, the attacker did their homework. This wasn't a panic dump, but a disciplined dispersal. By the time the security teams woke up, the trail was already cold, and the only evidence left was the on-chain equivalent of a middle finger.**

  
_The vault is empty, the addresses are washed, and the oracle is offline - so who exactly is left to pick up the tab?_  
  
### The Response Pivot  
  
_After the news hit, Aevo didn't waste time trying to patch the unpatchable. [They simply pulled the plug](https://www.theblock.co/post/382461/aevos-legacy-ribbon-dov-vaults-exploited-for-2-7-million-following-oracle-upgrade)._

**[All Ribbon vaults were immediately decommissioned](https://www.theblock.co/post/382461/aevos-legacy-ribbon-dov-vaults-exploited-for-2-7-million-following-oracle-upgrade). The tweet that announced both has since been deleted, along with their initial compensation plan.**  
  
[Aevo initially laid out a compensation plan](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2025-12-12-0/1), but the kickback was so bad that they backtracked and deleted the posts about it entirely.  
  

Users were being offered a withdrawal with a bit of a haircut. [Aevo was proposing that withdrawals be subject to only a 19% reduction](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2025-12-12-0/1) on the user's position's value at hack time.

  

Aevo’s initial compensation plan relied on two pillars. First, [the DAO was going to forfeit its own vault positions - roughly $400,000 in assets](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2025-12-12-0/1) - to absorb some of the impact. A noble gesture, but one that only covers a fraction of the $2.7 million hole.

  

_The real subsidy would have come from the dead._

  

**The protocol explicitly stated that [many of the largest depositors have been dormant for 2–4 years](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/archive/2025-12-12-0/1). These are wallets that deposited during the DeFi summer of yesteryear and seemingly forgot they exist.** 
  
Aevo was banking, literally, on the assumption that these "zombie" users will simply never show up to claim their money.  
  
But then they had a change of heart or a twist of the arm.  
  
[Ribbon issued a stunning correction admitting their initial analysis was "fundamentally flawed,](https://x.com/ribbonfinance/status/2000988413072138427)" replacing the haircut proposal with a brutal binary: if you had already queued a withdrawal, you are safe; if your funds were "active," they may be gone.

  
**In the end, the attempt to engineer a soft landing via 'zombie' subsidies collapsed, revealing that for the active depositors, there was never a haircut to debate.**  
  
_When the only winning move is to withdraw before the team realizes they’re broke, are we actually engaging in decentralized finance, or just a digitized bank run?_

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png)











_There is no retirement home for smart contracts, only crime scenes waiting to happen._

  

**Aevo is just the latest chapter in the "Zombie Vault" saga, joining [Yearn](https://rekt.news/yearn-rekt3) and [Balancer](https://rekt.news/balancer-rekt2) in the expensive lesson that old code is often just a liability with a pulse.**  
  

  
That [2021 OpenZeppelin audit](https://www.openzeppelin.com/news/ribbon-finance-audit) might as well have been written in hieroglyphics. 

**While it rigorously stress-tested the original Ribbon V2 logic against the threats of yesterday, it offered zero protection when a sloppy maintenance patch in 2025 cracked the hull, bypassing years of security hardening in a single commit.**  
  
It’s the digital equivalent of parking an old clunker in the driveway and forgetting about it - eventually, someone stops admiring the paint job and starts stripping it for parts.  
  
As protocols chase the shiny new yields of L2s and "v3" deployments, they leave these ghost towns behind, fully funded but barely guarded.  
  
**"Deprecated" creates a false sense of security, implying a safety that no longer exists for code that is very much alive and solvent.**

  
_If the industry's strategy for old code is "ignore it until it breaks," how many more millions need to vanish before others learn to clean out the garage?_
