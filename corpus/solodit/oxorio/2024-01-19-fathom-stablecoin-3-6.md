##### Description
In the mentioned locations of the contract `FathomProxyWalletOwner` and the contract `FathomProxyWalletOwnerUpgradeable` the validation of variables for zero-value is redundant as the prior call `_validateAddress(proxyWallet)` passes only if `proxyWallet` was initialized, which is possible only after all the other contracts were initialized in the constructor or initializer.
##### Recommendation
We recommend removing the redundant validation to keep the codebase clean.
##### Update
###### Client's response
We would like to exclude `FathomProxyWalletOwner` and  `FathomProxyWalletOwnerUpgradeable`  from the audit scope.
