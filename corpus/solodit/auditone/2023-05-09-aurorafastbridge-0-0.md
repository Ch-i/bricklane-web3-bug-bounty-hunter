**Description**: 

Block reorg, also known as blockchain reorganization, is a situation where a competing chain replaces the main blockchain. This can happen when multiple miners find valid blocks at the same time, and the network has to decide which block to include in the blockchain. In some cases, the network may choose to include a block that is not in the main blockchain, resulting in a reorganization of the chain.

**Recommendations:**

To mitigate the risk of block reorgs, the Fast Bridge project may need to implement additional measures, such as waiting for multiple confirmations before proceeding with token transfers or implementing a fallback mechanism in case of a block reorg.
