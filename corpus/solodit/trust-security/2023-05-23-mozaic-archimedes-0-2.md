# TRST-H-3 All LayerZero requests will fail, making the contracts are unfunctional

_Section severity (from Solodit section header): High_  
_Audit firm: Trust Security_  
_Source report: [2023-05-23-Mozaic Archimedes.md](https://github.com/solodit/solodit_content/blob/main/reports/Trust%20Security/2023-05-23-Mozaic%20Archimedes.md)_

**Description:**
When sending messages using the LayerZero architecture, native tokens must be supplied to 
cover the cost of delivering the message at the receiving chain. However, none of the Mozaic 
contracts account for it. The controller calls the bridge's `requestSnapshot()`, `requestSettle()`, 
`requestExecute()` without passing value. Vault calls `reportSnapshot()`, `reportSettle()` similarly. 
StargatePlugin calls the StargateRouter's swap() which also requires value. As a result, the 
contracts are completely unfunctional.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Pass value in each of the functions above. Perform more meticulous testing with LayerZero 
endpoints. Contracts should support receiving base tokens with the `receive()` fallback, to pay 
for fees.

**Team response:**
Fixed

**Mitigation Review:**
The Controller and Vault now pass appropriate value in native tokens for messaging. The 
contracts can be topped-up with the `receive()` method.
